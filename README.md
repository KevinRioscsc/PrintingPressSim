This was one of my projects from a software development class
This was created in JAVA IDE NetBeans

General Description:
In this problem you will simulate a multiple printers processing job from a single print queue. To do this you will need to create the following classes:
TestPrintQueueSimulation – which includes the main program.
PrintQueueSimulation – controls the simulation and prints the outputs
Job – A class from which printing jobs are created
Printer – an object from which Printers are created

Main Objective:
This was my first time using data structures for something useful. What I mean is that usually when you learn a new topic 
the starting assignment for that topic are suppose to be relatively easy. This was the first time we were challenged by creating 
our own algorithm to solve a simulation. The goal here was to have a strong understanding of how data structures work.

Challenges:
One of the major challenges that I faced doing this program was the usage of null in queues. This was a simulation of printers, so 
there had to be multible queues. One for starting and finishing. The problem I had was checking to see if a printer was available or not. 
The printers were set into a array because the user selected how many printers will be in the simulation. After hours of trying to figure it out, I couldnt
and it was a real confidence breaker. I did not want to ask my professor because I felt like I relied on him to much, so I swallowed my pride
and kept going until eventually I figured out the power of null when messing with data structures. At first I thought mull was completely useless
but it can be used for an array of things. Null is also data so it can be used to check whether an array is empty or not which is what I needed

Things I Learned:
.Null is not completely useless
.Making queues
.Aggregation with data structures
